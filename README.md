Perfect — this confirms everything:

✅ Your custom domain www.skyrocketscanner.pro is linked.

⚠️ The “Enforce HTTPS” box is greyed out because DNS is still propagating (you’ll see “DNS Check in Progress”).



---

🔄 What’s Happening Now:

GitHub is waiting for full confirmation from your domain’s DNS provider (likely via Cloudflare or Name.com).

This process usually takes anywhere from 15 minutes to a few hours — rarely up to 24h.

✅ What You Should Do Next:

While DNS finishes syncing, let’s make sure your site actually shows something cool.

Here’s a solid mobile-ready index.html I built just now:

🔥 HTML Code (Paste This Into Your Repo):

You can add or replace your current index.html with this:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>Skyrocket Scanner 🚀</title>
  <style>
    body {
      background-color: #0e0e0e;
      color: #ffffff;
      font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;
      text-align: center;
      padding: 5vh 2rem;
    }
    h1 {
      font-size: 2.5rem;
      margin-bottom: 1rem;
    }
    p {
      font-size: 1.2rem;
      color: #cccccc;
    }
    .status {
      margin-top: 2rem;
      padding: 1rem;
      background-color: #1e1e1e;
      border-radius: 10px;
      border: 1px solid #333;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>🚀 Skyrocket Scanner is Lifting Off</h1>
  <p>This landing site is now active.</p>
  <div class="status">
    <strong>Status:</strong> Live<br/>
    <strong>Next:</strong> HTTPS + scanner dashboard in progress...
